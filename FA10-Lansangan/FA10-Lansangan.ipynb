    "The Cholesterol over Time dataset aims to evaluate whether two brands of margarine (Brand A and Brand B) have different effects on cholesterol levels over time. The dataset includes repeated measurements of cholesterol levels taken at three time points: before starting the intervention, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks.\n",

    "Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): There is no significant difference in cholesterol levels between the two brands of margarine over the three time points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): There is a significant difference in cholesterol levels between the two brands of margarine over the three time points.\n",
    "\n",
    "We ought to test the null hypothesis at a 0.05 significance level. In other words, we ought to reject the null hypothesis if and only if p-value < 0.05. But it is also worth noting the choosing a 0.05 level of significance poses a risk of commiting a type I error (false positive; rejecting null hypothesis when it should be accepted) 5% of the time.\n",

    "A two-way ANOVA was conducted to analyze the effects of gender and eucation level on political interests of students. Residualt analysis was done to test for assumptions before conducting two-way ANOVA. The outliers were assessed through IQR method and inspection of boxplot, the result from both method showed no sign of any signicant outliers. A Shapiro-Wilk test was also done to test for normality of the residual distributions and they beg no deviation from normality (*p>.05*). A Levene's test was done to test for homogeneity of variance and we have fail to reject the null hypothesis of having homogeneity of variances (*p=.07*). \n",

Therefore, an analysis of simple main effects for education level was also performed with Bonferroni adjustment and acceptance at the p < 0.0167 level. The result of the simple main effects showed a significant difference in mean \"Polical Interest\" scores for males under either school, college, or university level (*F(2,52)=266.29, p<.0001, patial $\\eta^2$=.96*). It is the same case for females under school, college, or university level (*F(2,52)=42.97, p<.0001, patial $\\eta^2$=.76*).
