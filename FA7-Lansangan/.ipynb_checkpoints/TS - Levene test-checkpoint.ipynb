    "The one-way ANOVA results show if the nominal variable has an influence on the mean results in the scale variable. The next thing to do would then be to find out which category are significantly different from each other. A post-hoc analysis that will compare each possible pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are doing multiple tests, we have a danger of making a wrong decision of 5% each time. Although this seems low, it can quickly compound to making at least one wrong decision. Therefor the regular significance for each pairwise test gets adjusted. There are various methods to do this adjustment,  and they are divided into two camps: those if the variance is the same in the population, and those for if the variances are not the same. Before we can go to testing the means, we therefor first need to test if the variances in the population could be the same. One possible test for this is the Levene F-test (Levene, 1960)."
